# Galactris
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Glactris is my version of Tetris with my own twist.
My mom loved Tetris so I wanted to create a Tetris game
dedicated to her.
I developed the application using Programming Language Python, IDE Pycharm and Pygame. There were ups and downs during
development of this project learning new concept and new ways to code.

## Log 1. - 2.1.2023

. I am reseaching the concept of building a tetris game

. I've updated my pip to the latest version on pycharm

. I've installed pygame to pycharm

. reading through pygame fuctions on pygame.com

. Created Tetris.py file

. imported pygame and random

. planning next steps luckily for me there are tons of Tetris tutorials and resouces online I can grab from. 

. for me its important that I write the code and devolope muscle memory and confidence in coding displaying me ability to learn and grow.

. applying new concepts and challeging myself

. The only way to become a master coder... is to CODE!

## Log 2. - 2.1.2023 

. I have begun constructing and understanding how to create the Tetris game

. I need to create the data structure for shapes

. I need to set up global variables

. create functions

. create a grid

. draw the grid

. draw game window

. Create the game window

. creating a way of rotating shapes

. Key binding the arrows keys to rotate shapes

. learning and utilize class function

. utilizing colors by numbers 0, 0, 0,

. game start up game quit functions

. Make it Look cool while learning alot.

END OF LOG...


## Log 3. - 2.2.2023

. Building a Tretris game is a challenge and its forcing me to learn new concepts and think of coding differently.

. debugging my code every step of the way has help me have less errors when test running my code.

. I have utilized pygame.com and google quite a bit to help me along the way.

. they say to become a master software developer my reserching needs to be just as good as my coding and I see why.

.embedded code, integers, floats, lists, all concepts I am becoming even more familiar with and am utilzing in my code

END OF LOG...

## Log 4. - 2.4.2023

. During the stage of me coding the game I ran into an issue with my IDE.

. The import fuction was not working. I couldnt import pygame or anything else for that matter.

. I was perplexed, with no clue as to why. I researched online for a fix updating my pip through the command prompt on my windows PC.

. I updated my setuptools and my wheel directly from th command prompt.

. I then found that I had mutliple version of python installed which gave me multiple interpreters in my IDE (pycharm)

. I also had mulitple paths in my directory.

. To solve my issues I unstalled everything and completed deleted all files paths and programs.

. loosing all my progress yes im sure this was a drastic choice but I felt it had to be done.

. I then installed the latest version of python and pycharm

. I updated my pip and setuptools for pygame to work properly

. Then I installed pygame from the command prompt and all is well

. I have begun a new making 4 .py files to spread out my code for simplicty seems to work well

. Galactris is up and running but there are still more things I want to do but for now this is good enough to submit.

. Going over what each file holds

. galactris.py holds: The fonts and what is diplayed while playing the game. It also holds the collison system and the speed at which each tetromino falls.
  
. main.py holds:  application class for the pygame library. The main game loop that calls three methods
  
. settings.py holds:  The frame rate for the application. The color of the grid as well as the size. The Structure for Tetrominos. The sprite group is also defined in this file.
  
. tetromino.py holds:  The Class for the tetrominos and the structure of the tetrominos created the spites images is created in this file
  
. Of course its more to it but thats the gist. as I implement more features I will continue to update this READ.ME
