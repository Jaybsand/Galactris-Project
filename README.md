## Log 3. - 2.2.2023

. Building a Tretris game is a challenge and its forcing me to learn new concepts and think of coding differently.

. debugging my code every step of the way has help me have less errors when test running my code.

. I have utilized pygame.com and google quite a bit to help me along the way.

. they say to become a master software developer my reserching needs to be just as good as my coding and I see why.

.embedded code, integers, floats, lists, all concepts I am becoming even more familiar with and am utilzing in my code
