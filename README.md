. for me its important that I write the code and devolope muscle memory and confidence in coding displaying me ability to learn and grow.

. applying new concepts and challeging myself

. The only way to become a master coder... is to CODE!

. Building a Tretris game is a challenge and its forcing me to learn new concepts and think of coding differently.

. debugging my code every step of the way has help me have less errors when test running my code.

. I have utilized pygame.com and google quite a bit to help me along the way.

. they say to become a master software developer my reserching needs to be just as good as my coding and I see why.

.embedded code, integers, floats, lists, all concepts I am becoming even more familiar with and am utilzing in my code

## Log 4. - 2.4.2023

. During the stage of me coding the game I ran into an issue with my IDE.

. The import fuction was not working. I couldnt import pygame or anything else for that matter.

. I was perplexed, with no clue as to why. I researched online for a fix updating my pip through the command prompt on my windows PC.

. I updated my setuptools and my wheel directly from th command prompt.

. I then found that I had mutliple version of python installed which gave me multiple interpreters in my IDE (pycharm)

. I also had mulitple paths in my directory.

. To solve my issues I unstalled everything and completed deleted all files paths and programs.

. loosing all my progress yes im sure this was a drastic choice but I felt it had to be done.

. I then installed the latest version of python and pycharm

. I updated my pip and setuptools for pygame to work properly

. Then I installed pygame from the command prompt and all is well

. I have begun a new making 4 .py files to spread out my code for simplicty seems to work well

. I changed the name of my project from tetris to galactris to give it more flavor and be more ambitious for this project.
